## **Chapter 1: Getting Started**

This handbook explains how things work here: our policies, our perks, and the culture that shapes our work. It is meant to be useful on your first day and on your three-hundredth. If something feels unclear, ask. If something feels outdated, suggest a change. This is a living document, not a rulebook carved in stone.

### Why this handbook exists

Clarity saves time. Instead of guessing how things are done, we write it down. That way, new people can settle in faster, and the team can focus on work rather than uncertainty.

### How to use this handbook

* If you’re new: start at the beginning and move through the chapters.

* If you’re already on the team: use it as a reference and update us when reality has shifted.

* If you’re just curious: this is a window into how we operate.

## **Chapter 2: Benefits & Perks**

This section lays out the basics you can count on. The language is simple by design, but every word matters.

### Paid Time Off / Privilege Leave

Everyone gets **20 days of privilege leave** each year. Use them when you need a break, a vacation, or personal time. Plan ahead, let your team know, and actually take the time — it’s good for you and good for the work.

### Sick Leave

You also get **10 sick days** each year. If you’re unwell, rest and recover — no questions asked. Sick day WFH is also fine, no questions asked. There is always flexibility with sick leaves. The goal is to keep you healthy and avoid spreading illness. Just give your team a quick heads-up.

*Note: There is no provision for carry-forward or encashment of unused leaves.*

### Public Holidays 2025

We observe the official national and state holidays. These are refreshed annually, but for 2025 the list is:

* **25 Dec (Thu):** Christmas

If the government declares special days or emergencies, we follow those notifications. Compensatory working days may sometimes be added, often on a Saturday.

Accrual of Privilege Leaves

This policy outlines the system for employees to accrue additional privilege leaves by working extra days in the office. This system is designed to reward employees for their commitment while maintaining a sustainable and fair framework for the company.

1. ### **Formula for Additional Leave Accrual**

   Additional leaves are accrued based on the number of days an employee works in the office beyond their standard three-day-per-week roster. The calculation for leaves is as follows:

   **Total Leaves Accrued** \= (Total Extra Days in Office)/3

   The use of the floor function ensures that only whole leave days are awarded, preventing the accrual of partial or fractional leaves. Any remaining extra days (one or two) will not be carried over or rounded up.

2. ### **Upper Limit and Capping**

   To ensure the long-term viability of this benefit and to prevent the company from incurring an unsustainable leave liability, an upper limit has been established.

   The maximum number of additional privilege leaves that can be accrued by any employee under this policy is **15 days per calendar year**.

3. ### **Sample Calculation**     Here is an example for an employee who comes into the office five days a week. 

* **Employee's Roster:** 3 days in the office, 2 days working from home  
* **Actual Attendance:** 5 days in the office  
* **Extra Days per Week:** 5 (actual) \- 3 (roster) \= 2 extra days  
* **Extra Days per Month:** Assuming 4 weeks in a month, the employee works an additional 2×4=8 days in the office

  Now, we apply the formula:

  **Total Leaves Accrued** \= (Total Extra Days in Office)/3

  For this month, the calculation would be:

  **Total Leaves Accrued** \= 8/3 \= 2.66 \= 2 extra leaves accumulated

  After one month, this employee would have earned **2 extra privilege leaves**.

  The policy specifies an upper limit of **15 days per calendar year**. At a rate of 2 extra leaves per month, the employee would reach the cap in approximately 7.5 months. Once they hit the 15-day cap, they would no longer accrue additional leaves under this policy for the rest of the year. This ensures the system remains fair and sustainable.

### Family Leave

Parenthood changes life. We support it fully. Maternity leave is **26 weeks of fully paid time off**, as required by Indian law. Paternity leave is **2 weeks**, to be taken flexibly within the first 6 months. These are not perks, they are essentials — time to care for your family without stress or compromise.

### Health & Wellness

Every employee is covered under our health insurance plan through **Onsurity**, with options to extend coverage to dependents. This includes standard hospitalization and health benefits. The details are provided at onboarding. Wellness resources and support programs are also available — use them when you need them. Staying well matters more than pushing through.

### Work Culture Perks

* **Hybrid rhythm:** Three days in the office, two days remote. This balance helps us stay collaborative and flexible.

* **Flexible hours:** Focus on results, not punching the clock. Trust is given, responsibility is expected.

* **Learning kitty:** Use the stipend for courses, books, or conferences. If it makes you better at your craft, it’s worth it.

* **Team rituals:** From Monday Kickoffs to Friday Reviews, and the occasional creative jam, these keep the team connected and inspired.

## **Chapter 3: How We Work**

Work here is fast, focused, and creative. Campaigns, products, and experiments move quickly, but clarity always comes before speed.

### Our Rhythm

* **Hybrid balance:** Three days in office, two days remote. Pick the rhythm that lets you do your best work while staying connected.

* **Campaign velocity:** We aim for “Brief to Feed in 24h.” That doesn’t mean rushed — it means cutting noise, clarifying briefs, and shipping quickly.

* **Deep work:** Meetings are short and rare. Most updates are async. Output matters more than hours clocked.

### Managers of One

Everyone is expected to act as a **manager of one**. That means setting your own direction when none is given, deciding what needs to be done, and doing it without waiting for instructions. A manager of one doesn’t need babysitting. Left alone, they spend their time well, push projects forward, and improve things without being asked.

### Our Principles

* **AI-first:** AI is a creative partner, not a crutch. Experiment with tools, question results, and push ideas further.

* **Clarity over cleverness:** Be direct. Write things down. Document decisions.

* **Feedback culture:** Feedback is fast, specific, and about the work — never personal.

* **Trust and responsibility:** You own your tasks end to end. Micromanagement has no place here.

### Our Style

* **Creative sharpness:** Campaigns should be witty, clear, and memorable.

* **Iterate quickly:** Launch small, improve fast, learn every round.

* **Respect focus:** Protect your time and others’. Noise kills creativity.

## **Chapter 4: Making a Career**

A career here is about growth, ownership, and learning. Roles are flexible, paths are not rigid, and titles follow impact, not the other way around.

### Growth Paths

* **Creative:** Intern → Designer → Senior Creative → Manager

* **Business:** Intern → Associate → Senior Associate → Manager

* **Tech:** Junior Dev → Developer → Senior Developer

* **Strategy & Ops:** Analyst → Manager

People move across tracks when skills, interests, and business needs align.

### Feedback and Reviews

* **Continuous feedback:** Frequent, specific, always about the work.

* **6-Month reviews:** Twice a year, including self-evaluation, peer input, and manager discussion.

* **Career check-ins:** Request a career conversation anytime.

### Learning and Development

* **Learning kitty:** Use it for courses, books, or conferences.

* **AI-first growth:** Experiment, share learnings, teach others.

* **Mentorship:** Seniors coach juniors. Juniors ask questions fearlessly.

### Ownership

See an opportunity? Claim it. See a gap? Fix it. Growth comes from ownership.

## **Chapter 5: Our Rituals**

Rituals give rhythm to our weeks. Without them, every week feels like noise. With them, we move in sync. They aren’t about ceremony — they’re about focus.

### Monday Kickoff

We start with quick async updates. Everyone shares what they’re focusing on this week. Priorities become clear, and overlaps are spotted early.

### Trend Hunts

Once a week, the team brings in signals from culture, tech, and media. These sessions sharpen our instincts and keep our ideas plugged into the world.

### Brief to Feed

A campaign brief enters on Day 1\. By Day 2, creative, copy, and content are ready to ship. This ritual keeps us fast, but also forces clarity: a vague brief can’t survive Brief to Feed.

### Friday Reviews

We close each week by looking at what shipped. Wins are celebrated. Misses are dissected without blame. The point is learning, not scoring.

### Team Time

Occasional lunches, game nights, or creative jams. These remind us that behind the campaigns are humans.

## **Chapter 6: Managing Work Devices**

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is allowed. Productivity often comes from comfort with your own setup. With that freedom comes responsibility.

### Personal Devices

* Use your own laptop or desktop if you prefer.

* Keep it secure and updated.

* Protect client and company data.

* Cloud services are preferred so devices are never a roadblock.

### Software and Licensing

* Only use properly licensed software.

* Work licenses (Figma, Canva, Basecamp, etc.) are issued for your scope.

* Using unlicensed or unauthorized software is a personal liability.

### AI Tools

* Explore tools that improve productivity and creativity.

* Respect data privacy when using third-party AI. Never upload sensitive client info into public models without clearance.

### Support

* Ops handles company-issued licenses and tool access.

* Device upkeep is your own responsibility.

## **Chapter 7: Our Internal Systems**

Our stack is simple, cloud-first, and collaborative.

### Core Platform

* **Basecamp:** The hub for everything. Tasks, docs, communication, and projects all live here. If it’s not in Basecamp, it didn’t happen.

### Creative and Design Tools

* **Figma:** Design and prototyping.

* **Canva:** Quick content creation.

* **Google Sheets:** Data, tracking, and analysis.

### Development and Deployment

* **Supabase:** Databases and authentication.

* **Vercel:** Hosting and deployments.

* **In-house tools:** Attendance, analytics, and special client deployments.

### AI Models

* AI models are used across creative, strategy, and tech. Gemini Pro 2.5 is part of the all-team stack. Explore responsibly and document your use cases.

## **Chapter 8: A Note About Moonlighting**

Side projects are good. They keep curiosity alive and sharpen your skills. But loyalty comes first.

### What’s Allowed

* Hobbies, creative experiments, and learning gigs that make you sharper at your craft.

* Projects that don’t compete with our services or clients.

### What’s Not Allowed

* Paid work from a direct competitor.

* Using TalkXO resources, data, or client information outside.

* Side work that interferes with deadlines, quality, or availability.

### Expectations

Client work and responsibilities come first. If moonlighting fuels your growth, it’s welcome. If it distracts you, it’s a problem. When in doubt, ask. Transparency avoids trouble.

### Consequences

Breaches are not just about rules — they are about broken trust. Minor issues may lead to a warning. Repeated or serious breaches can end employment. Trust is hard to earn and easy to lose.

---

## **Chapter 9: Code of Conduct**

This isn’t about policing. It’s about protecting how we work together.

Respect, professionalism, integrity, collaboration, and responsibility aren’t abstract values — they’re daily habits.

* Answer messages clearly and on time

* Show up prepared

* Own your mistakes

* Share credit

* Ask for help

* Keep promises

* Protect client trust

If we get these basics right, we don’t need thick manuals. If we get them wrong, no manual can save us.

## **Chapter 10: State Leave Provisions**

This section reflects statutory leave entitlements under Indian law. These apply in addition to our own policies.

### National and Festival Holidays

* 3 national holidays are mandatory: Republic Day (26 Jan), Independence Day (15 Aug), and Gandhi Jayanti (2 Oct).

* Additional state holidays are based on government notifications.

### Earned Leave

* Shops & Establishments Acts generally require 1 day earned leave for every 20 days worked.

* Our privilege leave policy meets or exceeds this.

### Maternity Leave

* 26 weeks paid, as per the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act. Fully compliant.

### Paternity Leave

* Not mandated by law, but we provide 2 weeks voluntarily.

### Compliance Note

* Laws vary by state. This chapter is refreshed annually. If company policy and law conflict, the law prevails.

### Special Days and Emergencies

* Compensatory working days may be scheduled, often adjusted to a Saturday.

## **Closing Note**

This handbook is a living document. Policies and practices will change as we grow. Everyone is encouraged to suggest edits or raise questions. Clarity is the goal, not bureaucracy.
