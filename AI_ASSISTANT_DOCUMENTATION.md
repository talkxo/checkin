## API Reference

### Assistant Endpoint

**POST** `/api/ai/assistant`

Request body:
```json
{
  "query": "What are the leave policies?",
  "conversationHistory": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Previous question"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant", 
      "content": "Previous answer"
    }
  ]
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "Assistant generated response",
  "sources": ["Benefits & Perks", "Leave Policy"],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Knowledge Base Management Endpoints

**GET** `/api/admin/knowledge-base` - Retrieve all knowledge base items
**POST** `/api/admin/knowledge-base` - Create new knowledge base item
**PUT** `/api/admin/knowledge-base` - Update existing knowledge base item
**DELETE** `/api/admin/knowledge-base?id=<id>` - Delete knowledge base item

## Customization

### Adding New AI Models
The system supports multiple AI models through OpenRouter. To add new models:

1. Update the `models` array in `/lib/ai.ts`
2. Add fallback models in order of preference
3. Configure model-specific parameters

### Extending Knowledge Base
To add new knowledge base categories:

1. Add content to the `COMPANY_KNOWLEDGE_BASE` array in `/app/api/ai/assistant/route.ts`
2. Update the knowledge base manager interface
3. Test with sample queries

### Customizing UI
The Assistant uses the existing design system:
- Colors: Purple theme (`purple-600`, `purple-700`)
- Components: UI components from `/components/ui/`
- Icons: Font Awesome icons

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Speech Recognition Not Working**
   - Ensure you're using Chrome or Edge browser
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Verify HTTPS connection (required for speech API)

2. **Assistant Responses Not Loading**
   - Check OpenRouter API key configuration
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Knowledge Base Not Updating**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check admin permissions
   - Verify API endpoint accessibility

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking browser console for detailed error messages and API responses.

## Security Considerations

- All API calls are authenticated through the existing auth system
- Knowledge base content is validated and sanitized
- Speech data is processed locally and not stored
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables

## Performance Optimization

- Knowledge base search uses efficient keyword matching
- Conversation history is limited to prevent memory issues
- AI responses are cached where appropriate
- Speech recognition is optimized for accuracy and speed

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for multiple languages
- **Advanced Analytics**: Usage analytics and insights
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with external knowledge sources
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
- **Voice Response**: Text-to-speech for responses

### Scalability Improvements
- **Vector Database**: Implement proper vector similarity search
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-based response caching
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple AI model instances
- **Database Storage**: Persistent knowledge base storage
